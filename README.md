# typing-practice-launcher
AHK script to launch my daily typing practice.  What I do is go for perfect execution in TypeRacer at some tempo for five minutes and then raise that BPM by 1 every day if I don't make any mistakes.  Then, I try to go as fast as I can in Keybr for a bit.

Here's the idea:
- [X] Be able to start practice by `<C-A t>` hotkey.
- [X] Run at Windows startup, but only before noon.  
- [X] Stay persistent to provide hotkeys for TypeRacer.  Don't want to use mouse at all.
- [X] Open Typing.txt.  
- [ ] Extract current BPM from Typing.txt.
- [ ] Open web metronome.
- [ ] Set BPM and start metronome.
- [ ] Set laptop volume to 15.
- [ ] Open TypeRacer.  
- [ ] Start a solo practice in TypeRacer.
- [ ] Open Keybr in another browser tab.
- [ ] Provide TypeRacer hotkeys so that no mouse use in necessary.
- [ ] Provide hotkey to close on success: Bump BPM, close everything, and exit.
