# typing-practice-launcher
AHK script to launch my daily typing practice.

Here's the idea:
- [ ] Run at startup.  At first will launch by `<C-A t>` hotkey.
- [ ] Stay persistent to provide hotkeys for TypeRacer.  Don't want to use mouse at all.
- [ ] Open Typing.txt.  Extract current BPM from there.
- [ ] Open web metronome and set BPM.  Start metronome.
- [ ] Set laptop volume to 15.
- [ ] Open TypeRacer.  Start a practice.
- [ ] Open Keybr in another browser tab.
- [ ] Hotkey to close on success: Bump BPM, close everything, and exit.
